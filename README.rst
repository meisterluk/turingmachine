Turingmachine project
=====================

:project:       turingmachine
:date:          June-Aug 2013

:state:         shut down incomplete

The turingmachine project is an implementation of a Turingmachine
as web application. It is meant to be used in courses about the
topic of theoretical computer science. However, it might just be
fun playing around with it :)

The current state does not provide anything interesting.

The project was shut down in Aug 2013 due to recurring annoying
instabilities of the Google Dart interpreter. The turingmachine.js
project follows up this project and is implemented in native
javascript.

Next steps
----------

* API Documentation (with dartdoc)
* User Documentation (with Sphinx_)
* UI Frontend design

.. _Sphinx: http://sphinx-doc.org/

Notes
-----

* provide case-insensitive mode for states
